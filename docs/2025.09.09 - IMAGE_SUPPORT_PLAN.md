# Inline Images & Mermaid Support Plan

This document outlines the design and steps to add inline image support (PNG, WEBP, SVG) and Mermaid diagrams to mdmdview. No code has been changed yet; this is a plan for review.

## Goals
- Parse and render inline images referenced in Markdown (local files and data URIs; no network by default).
- Support formats: PNG, WEBP, SVG.
- Add Mermaid diagram rendering (as SVG) behind opt-in feature flags with safe, offline-first defaults.
- Scale images to the viewport width by default while preserving aspect ratio.
- Keep UI responsive; avoid blocking in `update()`; cache decoded/rasterized images.

## Crates & Features
- Image decoding
  - `image` (already in use) with features for `png`, `jpeg`, `gif`, `bmp`, `ico`, and `webp`.
  - Optionally `egui_extras` with `image`/`svg` features for convenience helpers.
- SVG rendering
  - `usvg` (parse) + `resvg` (render) + `tiny-skia` (raster target) to produce RGBA for `egui` textures.
- Mermaid rendering (opt-in)
  - `mermaid-quickjs` feature: embed a JS engine (e.g., `rquickjs`) and Mermaid JS to produce SVG locally.
- Cargo feature flags (proposal)
  - `images` (default): PNG/WEBP via `image`.
  - `svg` (default): allow SVG load + rasterization via `usvg`/`resvg`.
  - `mermaid-quickjs` (opt-in): offline Mermaid → SVG.

Note: align crate versions with `egui/eframe 0.27` and current `image 0.24`. Adjust versions during implementation as needed.

## Architecture Changes
- Extend render model with an explicit image element and caching.
- Rasterize into `ColorImage` then allocate as `TextureHandle` via `egui`.
- Cache textures keyed by source + scale to avoid repeated decoding/rasterizing.

### Data Model
- Add to `src/markdown_renderer.rs`:
  - `MarkdownElement::Image { src: String, alt: String, title: Option<String> }`.
  - `image_textures: RefCell<HashMap<ImageKey, egui::TextureHandle>>`.
  - `struct ImageKey { source_id: String, content_hash: u64, width_bucket: u32 }`.
- `source_id` examples:
  - Absolute normalized path + last-modified time for files.
  - `data:` URI hash for embedded.

### Parser Changes
- In `parse()` when handling pulldown-cmark events, capture `Event::Start(Tag::Image(link_type, url, title))` and subsequent `Event::Text(alt)` until `Event::End(Tag::Image(..))`.
- Resolve relative paths against current file directory (if available) or process CWD when editing raw content.
- Reject `http/https` sources by default (render placeholder + open-link action), unless a future opt-in is implemented.
- Allow `data:` URIs within size limits (e.g., ≤ 4 MB) and decode accordingly.

## Rendering Pipeline
- PNG/WEBP
  - Load bytes from file or `data:` URI.
  - Decode via `image` → `DynamicImage` → `to_rgba8` → `egui::ColorImage` → allocate texture.
  - Compute display size based on viewport width (minus padding), preserving aspect ratio.
  - Cache texture by `ImageKey` to avoid redundant work.

- SVG
  - Load SVG text/bytes (local file or data URI only; no external references).
  - Parse via `usvg`. Determine intrinsic size/viewport.
  - Compute target width (fit-to-viewport). Rasterize via `resvg` into `tiny_skia::Pixmap` with computed scale; convert to `ColorImage` and upload.
  - Cache at width bucket (e.g., rounded to nearest 32 px) to minimize cache churn on slight layout changes.

- Mermaid (feature-gated)
  - `mermaid-quickjs`: Initialize QuickJS context once; load Mermaid JS script (embedded string). Render diagram text to an SVG string. Pass SVG into the same SVG pipeline above. Time-box execution; deny network/FS.
  - Fallback when disabled or on errors: render code block with a small inline warning and keep the original code visible.

- Error Handling
  - Show a framed placeholder block when the image fails to load: include alt text, a brief error message, and the resolved path.
  - Never panic; use `anyhow::Result` internally and surface graceful UI messages.

## Scaling & Layout
- Default behavior: fit images to the available content width while preserving aspect ratio.
- Clamp maximum rasterized width to a safe texture limit (e.g., 4096 px or queried GPU limit when available).
- Optional phase-2 enhancements:
  - Click to toggle fit ↔ 100% size per-image.
  - Mouse wheel over image to zoom; Ctrl+0 to reset.
- Downscale with a quality filter (e.g., `imageops::resize` with `Lanczos3`) for better results when reducing size before upload.

## Performance & Caching
- Lazy decode/rasterize on first paint for each image.
- LRU cache: evict least-recently-used textures when total texture memory exceeds a watermark (e.g., 256–512 MB). Track approx memory size by width × height × 4.
- Invalidate cache entries if source file mtime or content hash changes (on reload or explicit refresh).

## File Resolution & Security
- Relative paths resolved from the current markdown file directory when available; otherwise from process CWD.
- No network fetches by default. For `http/https` images, render a placeholder with an “Open link” button using existing link handling.
- Enforce size caps on input images to mitigate memory spikes.
- SVG safety: do not allow external references; treat only inline content. `usvg`/`resvg` avoid scripting—verify and enforce.

## UI Integration
- Rendering changes in `MarkdownRenderer`:
  - Add a case in element rendering to handle `MarkdownElement::Image` as a block-level element.
  - Use `ui.available_width()` to determine target width.
  - Optionally display `title` as a faint caption below the image.
- Accessibility/search:
  - Include image `alt`/`title` text in `element_plain_text()` so search/highlight works consistently.

## Testing Plan
- Unit tests (inline `#[cfg(test)]`):
  - Parser: `![]()`, `![alt](path)`, titles, relative vs absolute, data URIs; correct `MarkdownElement::Image` construction.
  - PNG/WEBP decode from small in-memory bytes; ensure texture creation does not panic and caches entries.
  - SVG: parse + rasterize from a tiny inline SVG string; verify path and sizing logic.
  - Mermaid (when feature enabled): render a trivial graph to SVG (non-empty), or skip when disabled.
- Integration tests:
  - Use `tempfile` to simulate relative paths alongside a temp markdown file; verify resolution and graceful errors for missing files.
  - Confirm `element_plain_text()` includes alt/title for search.
- Performance sanity:
  - Simulate multiple large images; ensure cache watermark triggers; verify eviction count increases and UI doesn’t block.

## Samples & Documentation
- Assets:
  - Add small sample images under `assets/samples/`: `sample.png`, `sample.webp`, `logo.svg`.
  - Include a `diagram.mmd` Mermaid sample (text) and a sample markdown referencing these.
- Embedded samples:
  - Update `src/sample_files.rs` to embed a new sample demonstrating PNG, WEBP, SVG, and Mermaid (with graceful fallback text when Mermaid is disabled).
- README updates:
  - Document supported formats, default scaling behavior, feature flags, security constraints (no-network default), and size limits.

## Milestones (Execution Order)
1. Select crates + add feature flags in `Cargo.toml` (no functional changes yet).
2. Extend parser and model: add `MarkdownElement::Image` and path resolution.
3. Implement PNG/WEBP rendering + caching; fit-to-width scaling.
4. Add SVG rendering via `usvg`/`resvg`; share cache/scaling path.
5. Prototype Mermaid (`mermaid-quickjs`) with fallback; keep disabled by default.
6. Add LRU cache + texture memory watermark; finalize scaling clamps.
7. Update embedded samples and add tests.
8. Documentation pass and release notes.

## Open Questions
- Should we allow HTTP/HTTPS images behind an opt-in runtime setting (still off by default)?
- Do we want per-image zoom interactions in phase 1, or defer to a later release?
- What’s an acceptable default memory watermark for textures on typical systems (256 MB vs 512 MB)?

If approved, I’ll start with the parser/model changes and a minimal PNG/WEBP renderer behind a new `images` feature, followed by SVG, then optional Mermaid.
