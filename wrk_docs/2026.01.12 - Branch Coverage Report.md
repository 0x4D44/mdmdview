## Changes Since Last Report
- Regenerated coverage reports and missing-branch output with an ignore regex that excludes glutin bindings.

## Observations
- Branch coverage is 100.00% for project sources when excluding generated bindings.
- src/app.rs branch coverage reached 100.00% (0 branches missed).
- src/markdown_renderer.rs branch coverage reached 100.00% (0 branches missed).
- src/mermaid_renderer.rs branch coverage is 100.00% (0 branches missed).
- coverage-missing-branches.txt is empty after filtering generated bindings.

## Generated Code in Coverage Output
- target/llvm-cov-target/.../egl_bindings.rs and .../wgl_extra_bindings.rs show 0% coverage (generated bindings under glutin_*_sys).
- Ran reports with --ignore-filename-regex to exclude these bindings for the latest summaries.
