## Changes Since Last Report
- Added Markdown renderer coverage for http remote image paths and inline remote placeholders.
- Added Mermaid worker test for MDMDVIEW_MERMAID_DOM_DEBUG branch.
- Regenerated coverage outputs in wrk_docs/coverage.json, wrk_docs/coverage-summary.txt, and wrk_docs/coverage.txt.

## Observations
- Branch coverage improved to 90.29%.
- Remaining branch gaps are concentrated in src/mermaid_renderer.rs and src/markdown_renderer.rs.

## Generated Code in Coverage Output
- target/llvm-cov-target/.../egl_bindings.rs and .../wgl_extra_bindings.rs show 0% coverage (generated bindings under glutin_*_sys).
- Consider excluding generated files via --ignore-filename-regex if you want totals focused on project sources.
