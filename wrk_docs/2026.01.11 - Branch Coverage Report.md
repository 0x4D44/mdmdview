## Changes Since Last Report
- Extended Mermaid dump-helper test inputs to cover dash/underscore labels and empty label generation for error dumps.
- Regenerated coverage outputs in wrk_docs/coverage.json, wrk_docs/coverage-summary.txt, wrk_docs/coverage.txt, and wrk_docs/coverage-missing-branches.txt.

## Observations
- Branch coverage improved to 91.33%.
- src/mermaid_renderer.rs branch coverage improved to 86.68% (59 branches missed).

## Generated Code in Coverage Output
- target/llvm-cov-target/.../egl_bindings.rs and .../wgl_extra_bindings.rs show 0% coverage (generated bindings under glutin_*_sys).
- Consider excluding generated files via --ignore-filename-regex if you want totals focused on project sources.
