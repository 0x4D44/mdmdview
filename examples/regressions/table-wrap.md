# Table Wrap Regression

Use this file when validating the default renderer (it ships enabled, but you can confirm via *View ▸ Table Wrap Overhaul* or by launching with `--table-wrap`). The Changes column intentionally forces multiple wraps so you can verify columns never overlap; if you need to reproduce the legacy behavior for comparison, launch with `--no-table-wrap`.
