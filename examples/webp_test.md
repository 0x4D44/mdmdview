# WEBP Image Test

This file is for testing WEBP decoding.

Place a small `.webp` image at `assets/samples/webp_sample.webp` (relative to the repo root),
then open this file in the app. The image should render inline and scale to the viewport width.

![WEBP Sample](../assets/samples/webp_sample.webp "WEBP sample")

Notes:
- Remote images (http/https) are disabled by default.
- If the image doesnâ€™t render, verify the file path and that the file is a valid WEBP.
