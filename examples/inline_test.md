# Inline Code Test

This file tests the inline code formatting fix.

## Before the Fix

Previously, inline code like `.npq` would appear on a separate line instead of staying inline with the text.

## Testing Inline Elements

Install the package with `pip install package-name` and then run the `.npq` script to process your files.

You can also use the `--help` flag to see options, and check the `config.toml` file for settings.

Some text with `inline code` in the middle of a sentence should stay on the same line.

Multiple inline elements: first `code1`, then `code2`, and finally `code3` all in one paragraph.

## More Examples

- Use `.md` files as input
- Run with `python script.py` command  
- Check the `output/` directory for results
- Configure via `settings.json` file

The `.exe` file should now display properly in Windows Explorer with an icon and metadata!
