# List of future features
- Keyboard menu accelerators: ALT+<>

- Visible match counter (n of m) with distinct highlight for current match
- Case-sensitive and whole-word search toggles

# Bug fixes
- Stop the window getting bigger each time it is reopened - I bet the window position/size saving doesn't take account the window menu/title bar.
