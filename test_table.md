# Table Test

Testing table column width and wrapping:

| Version | Date | Changes | Author |
|---------|------|---------|--------|
| 1.0 | 2025-11-10 | Initial comprehensive summary | Synthesized from resources |
| 2.0 | 2025-11-11 | Another very long description that should wrap properly within the column | Some other author name |
| 3.0 | 2025-11-12 | Short | Test |

This table should display correctly with text wrapping in columns as needed.
