# Test for Tofu Display Bug

## Regular ASCII Test
A 32-bit address bus would provide 2^32 = 4,294,967,296 bytes (4 GB) of addressable memory. In 1985, when typical PCs had 256 KB to 1 MB of RAM, 4 GB seemed nearly infinite.

## Unicode Superscript Test (if this is the issue)
A 32-bit address bus would provide 2³² = 4,294,967,296 bytes (4 GB) of addressable memory.

## Other Math Notation Tests
- Simple: 2^32
- With spaces: 2 ^ 32
- Unicode arrows: 2↑32
- Unicode minus: 2−32 (Unicode minus sign)
- Unicode multiplication: 2×32
- Various dashes: em—dash, en–dash, regular-dash

## Test Numbers
- Regular: 4294967296
- With commas: 4,294,967,296
- With Unicode spaces: 4 294 967 296 (using Unicode thin spaces)
