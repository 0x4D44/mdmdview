## LYRICS
[Intro: Acoustic Guitar]

[Verse 1]
You sailed to war
came home to me
We built a life in Liverpool
by the sea
You worked the docks
I raised our son
We thought the
fighting days were done

But they came in the night
Nineteen-forty-five
With papers and chains
For my husband, alive

[Chorus]
They took you in the night
No letter, no goodbye
(No goodbye, no goodbye)
Just empty rooms and questions
And a government's lie
You fought for this country
You kept Britain fed
{kept Britain fed}
And they sent you away
Like you were already dead
Without goodbye {without goodbye}

[Verse 2]
I waited at
the docks each day
Thinking you'd come
walking back my way
Our son asks
"Where's my father gone?"
I have no answer
just this song

File 213
Locked away
Nine-two-six reasons
They won't say
{won't say} {won't say}

[Pre-Chorus]
You married me,
you chose this land
They took you
for holding my hand
(For loving me)

[Chorus]
They took you in the night
No letter, no goodbye
(No goodbye, no goodbye)
Just empty rooms and questions
And a government's lie
You fought for this country
You kept Britain safe
{kept us safe}
And they sent you away
Without even seeing your face
Without goodbye {without goodbye}

[Bridge, powerful]
How do you
mourn someone who vanished?
How do you grieve a goodbye
you never got?
(Never got, never got)
How do you tell your children
Their father didn't leave
He was stolen, he was bought
{bought and sold}

Seventy years of silence
Seventy years of shame
They erased you from the story
But I still speak your name
{speak your name}

[Instrumental Break: Electric Guitar]

[Chorus, passionate]
They took you in the night
No appeal, no voice, no choice
(No choice at all)
Just racism written into law
And families destroyed
You served this country faithfully
You earned the right to stay
{right to stay}
But they deported you in secret
And took my love away

Without goodbye
Without goodbye
{without goodbye}

[Outro]
I'm still waiting at the docks
(Still waiting, still waiting)
Seventy years gone
(Seventy years)
And I'm still saying your name
Even though you never came home

Without goodbye
{You never said goodbye}

[End]

## SONG NOTES
**UDIO OPTIMIZATION:** Lines shortened for better singability and musical phrasing (4-8 words per line)


**Structure:** Verse-Chorus-Verse-Chorus-Bridge-Chorus-Outro
**Key Elements:**
- Personal story represents thousands of families
- Specific details (Liverpool, 1945, file 213/926) ground the narrative
- Anger and grief balanced throughout
- Questions in bridge universal to all forced separation
- Wife's voice centers women's experience of loss

**Performance Notes:**
- Should be powerful, not polite
- Anger should be righteous, not aggressive
- Bridge should build in intensity
- Final chorus should be anthemic
- Outro returns to intimate grief

**Why This Works:**
Combines personal intimacy (love story) with historical injustice (deportation). The title "Without Goodbye" captures the cruelty simply. Chorus hook is memorable and protest-ready. Balances political with personal perfectly.
