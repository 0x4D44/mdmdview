# 2026.01.20 - JRN - scroll-bug

- Started investigating scroll jump issue with large tables in markdown file.
- Feeling focused but wary of the UI scroll logic; need to reproduce carefully.
- Identified likely cause: row height estimation skipped for wrapped table text, leading to undercounted table height and scroll jumps.
- Implemented broader initial row height estimation for small tables and added a regression test for wrapped rows.
- Feeling cautiously optimistic; still a bit uneasy about screenshot tooling not showing content.
- cargo test initially failed on mermaid_renderer::tests::test_mermaid_worker_init_error_stages; reran full suite and it passed.
- Long test run but stable on retry; feeling relieved, slight concern about flaky test.
