# Journal: Pikchr Integration Implementation

**Date**: 2026-02-14
**Feature**: Pikchr Diagram Rendering Integration
**Design**: `wrk_docs/2026.02.14 - HLD - Pikchr Diagram Rendering Integration V6.md`

---

## Implementation Plan

Based on design doc V6 section 9.2, broken into sequential stages:

| Stage | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Scaffolding: Cargo.toml, lib.rs, skeleton pikchr_renderer.rs | Done (2e88a36) |
| 2 | TDD: Write unit tests + implement pikchr_renderer.rs core | Done (3836901) |
| 3 | Wire into markdown_renderer.rs + integration tests | Done (ff16250) |
| 4 | Sample files + sample verification tests | Done (b97e822) |
| 5 | Build debug + release, run full test suite | Done (981/984 pass) |
| 6 | CLAUDE.md update + version bump (1.6.1 -> 1.7.0) | Done (7298b75) |
| 7 | Code review (code-reviewer skill) | Done |
| 8 | Apply review feedback (code-review-apply-feedback skill) | Done |
| 9 | Final verification against V6 design | Pending |

## Log

### Stage 1 — Scaffolding (commit 2e88a36)
- Added `pikchr = ["dep:pikchr"]` feature to Cargo.toml (default enabled)
- Added conditional module declaration in src/lib.rs
- Created skeleton src/pikchr_renderer.rs with stub API
- Build verified: compiles with and without pikchr feature

### Stage 2 — Core Implementation (commit 3836901)
- 574 lines written in pikchr_renderer.rs
- LruCache<K,V> with true LRU access-order tracking (copied from mermaid_renderer)
- Full render pipeline: Pikchr→SVG→usvg/resvg→egui texture
- Dark mode via PikchrFlags builder API (NOT bitwise OR)
- fontdb with system fonts loaded (critical fix from V6 review)
- 16 unit tests all passing

### Stage 3 — Markdown Renderer Wiring (commit ff16250)
- 9 edits to markdown_renderer.rs (all cfg-gated)
- Code block dispatch, syntax highlight skip, lifecycle integration
- 2 integration tests added (parsing, highlight-skip)
- 18/18 pikchr tests passing

### Stage 4 — Sample Files (commit b97e822)
- Added pikchr.md sample with 3 diagrams
- **Caught V5 G3 issue**: `2nd last diamond.s` → `last diamond.s` (only one diamond)
- 3 sample verification tests confirm all samples render valid SVG
- SAMPLE_FILES count updated 7→8
- 21 pikchr tests + 11 sample tests all passing

### Stage 5 — Full Test Suite
- 981 passed, 2 failed (pre-existing, unrelated), 1 ignored
- Pre-existing failures: `test_read_file_lossy_invalid_utf8_returns_lossy` (file permissions), `test_poll_readability_discards_stale_result` (race condition)
- Zero pikchr-related test failures

### Stage 6 — Documentation (commit 7298b75)
- Added Pikchr Renderer to CLAUDE.md Core Components
- Added pikchr feature to Cargo Features docs
- Version bump 1.6.1 → 1.7.0

### Stage 7 — Code Review
- Two required changes identified: DRY violations
  1. `hash_str()` duplicated 3 times (pikchr_renderer, mermaid_renderer, markdown_renderer)
  2. `LruCache<K,V>` duplicated in pikchr_renderer and mermaid_renderer
- Two suggestions: one applied (named constant), two skipped (low priority)
- Two questions answered: cfg gate rationale, bucketing strategy differences

### Stage 8 — Apply Review Feedback
- Created `src/lru_cache.rs` with shared `LruCache<K,V>` and `hash_str()`
- Removed duplicates from all three consumer modules
- Fields `entries` and `order` exposed as `pub(crate)` for mermaid white-box tests
- Extracted `MAX_RASTER_SIDE` constant in pikchr_renderer
- All existing tests pass without modification (28 LruCache tests, 16 pikchr tests)
- Zero compiler warnings in debug and release builds

## Design Deviations

1. **Sample syntax fix**: Design V6 section 5.3.6 had `move to 2nd last diamond.s` which is invalid Pikchr when only one diamond exists. Changed to `move to last diamond.s`. This was caught by the sample verification tests — exactly the risk V5 finding G3 flagged.
