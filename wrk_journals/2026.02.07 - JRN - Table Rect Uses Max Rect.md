# Journal: Table Rect Uses Max Rect

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Design**: `wrk_docs/2026.02.07 - HLD - Table Rect Uses Max Rect.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE

## Progress Log

### Implementation — COMPLETE
- Initial agent run reported success but changes did NOT persist in the file
- Root cause: agent made changes in its own context but they weren't written to disk
- Applied changes directly: 3 edits at correct line numbers (4510-4514, 4553-4554)
- Code review: "Looks good", no required changes
- Applied reviewer nit: updated body-cell comment to reference header comment
- Tests: 901 passed, 0 failed, 1 ignored
- Clippy: 1 pre-existing warning (unused `r` at line 2916, unrelated)
- Release build: SUCCESS

### Changes Made
| # | Change | Location |
|---|--------|----------|
| 1 | Updated comment explaining `max_rect()` rationale | Lines 4510-4513 |
| 2 | `ui.min_rect()` → `ui.max_rect()` | Line 4514 (header cells) |
| 3 | `ui.min_rect()` → `ui.max_rect()` + updated comment | Line 4555 (body cells) |

### Code Review
- Reviewer: general-purpose agent
- Verdict: **Looks good** — no required changes
- 1 nit applied: cross-reference comment at body cell site

### Lesson Learned
- Always verify agent-reported changes actually persisted by grepping for the expected code
- The implementation agent's bash tools may write to a sandboxed context
