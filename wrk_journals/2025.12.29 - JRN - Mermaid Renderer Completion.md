# JRN - Mermaid Renderer Completion

Date: 2025.12.29

## Entry 1
Reviewed prior Mermaid HLD/plan and the current implementation in `src/mermaid_renderer.rs`, `src/markdown_renderer.rs`, `build.rs`, `Cargo.toml`, and `README.md`. Stage 0-4 work appears implemented (embedded QuickJS path, DOM shim, worker pool, caching, config merge, security defaults, Kroki opt-in). Remaining completion items likely center on default feature selection, Kroki feature gating, docs/sample updates, and expanded QuickJS/regression tests. Next: write an updated HLD and completion plan.

## Entry 2
Authored completion HLD and implementation plan covering default feature selection, Kroki feature gating, capability-aware renderer selection, QuickJS validation tests, regression harness integration for Mermaid, and documentation/licensing updates.
