# 2026.01.20 - JRN - Mermaid HTML Labels

- Task: allow Mermaid inline HTML tags (e.g., <i>, <b>) to render as formatting instead of literal text.
- Approach: detect safe tags in diagram code, pass an internal allow flag into Mermaid config, and honor it in the render wrapper; keep strict security as default.
- Documentation: noted safe inline tag allowance in README.
- Tests: cargo fmt --all; cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings; cargo test -q.
- Insights: strict mode can still support a narrow safe tag list without relaxing the global security setting.
- Blockers: mdtimeout kept killing tests until I used a longer tool timeout; resolved.

Feelings: brief frustration with the timeout behavior, then relief once the full test run completed. Energy steady.
