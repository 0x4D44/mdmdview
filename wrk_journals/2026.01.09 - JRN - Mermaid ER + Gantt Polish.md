# 2026.01.09 - JRN - Mermaid ER + Gantt Polish

## Summary
- Investigated remaining ER background and gantt font-size diffs; gantt already within threshold after viewport width fix.
- Identified ER visual diff as size mismatch (QuickJS output slightly larger than mermaid-cli).
- Added kerning-aware text measurement and ER-specific scale adjustment to reduce ER output size.

## Work Completed
- Added kerning support to TextMeasurer using `kern` subtables when available to match browser text widths.
- Added ER-only scale adjustment during rasterization to reduce overall size mismatch.
- Added tests for kerning and scale adjustment helpers.
- Rebuilt release and reran mermaid visual comparison for ER + gantt.

## Tests / Validation
- `cargo test --features mermaid-quickjs test_text_measurer_kerning_adjusts_width_when_available`
- `cargo test --features mermaid-quickjs test_scale_adjustment_for_svg_defaults`
- `python tools/mermaid_review_pack.py --case er --case gantt --output tests/mermaid_visual/review_pack/2026.01.08-fix10`

## Results
- ER diff now within threshold (7.93%).
- Gantt remains within threshold.
