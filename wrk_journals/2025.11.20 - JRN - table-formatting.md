[2025-11-20 09:22:52] Started implementation: focus on parsing fixes, table IDs, legacy image width heuristics. Created working plan and set stages 1,2,5 to tackle first.
[2025-11-20 09:25:46] Implemented Stage 1 parsing change to reuse inline parser with breaks for table cells. Updated table rendering pipeline to pass element index and ensure compute_table_id hashes position. Added tests for images/formatting in cells and unique table IDs. Adjusted legacy image width heuristic to avoid available-width inflation.
[2025-11-20 09:27:04] Ran cargo test table_ids_are_unique_per_position; build succeeded. Stages 1,2,5 marked complete.
[2025-11-20 11:39:56] Implemented adaptive header height estimation and row height growth repaint; column policy/stats upgrades (unicode-width, multi remainder cap). Fixed legacy image width heuristic. Added tests; full cargo test -- --nocapture passing. Plan updated (Stage 3 & 4 complete; Stage 6 pending docs/integration polish).
[2025-11-20 11:41:39] Added docs: TABLE_LAYOUT_QUICK_REFERENCE.md and README table wrap notes updated for adaptive heights, Unicode width sizing, multi remainder, per-table IDs, legacy image cap. All tests passing (cargo test -- --nocapture). Implementation plan stages completed.
